# GHG Emission Prediction System

The GHG Emission Prediction System is a data-driven solution that aims to address the pressing issue of crop-generated and farming-generated emissions in agricultural farms. The system provides a comprehensive methodology and predictive model to calculate overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, specifically tailored to mapped agricultural farmlands.

## Problem Statement
The current lack of data, standard methodologies, tools, and resources to calculate overall emissions in agricultural farms poses a significant challenge. To overcome this, the GHG Emission Prediction System focuses on mapping farm locations and leveraging existing emission data from public farms. By considering multiple parameters such as land usage, land area, farming type, technology used, and existing emissions, the system calculates proxy-based emissions for privately-owned farms.

## Features
* Farm Location Mapping: The GHG Emission Prediction System allows users to map farm locations using latitude and longitude coordinates, enabling accurate assessment and analysis of emissions.

* Proxy-based Emission Calculation: By leveraging existing emission data from public farms, the system calculates proxy-based emissions for privately-owned farms, considering various parameters that impact emissions.

* Predictive Emission Model: The system incorporates a predictive model that utilizes farm location and other relevant factors to forecast GHG emissions, providing insights into future emission trends.

* Data-driven Analysis: With the GHG Emission Prediction System, users can perform data-driven analysis and gain valuable insights into emission patterns, helping them make informed decisions for sustainable farming practices.

## Getting Started
To get started with the GHG Emission Prediction System, follow these steps:

## Install the required dependencies listed in the documentation.
* Obtain the necessary datasets and ensure they are properly formatted.
* Run the system's setup script to initialize the environment.
* Map the farm addresses to their corresponding locations using latitude and longitude.
* Utilize the provided API or interface to input the required parameters and generate emission predictions.
* Analyze the results, visualize the data, and gain valuable insights into GHG emissions.
* For more detailed instructions and examples, refer to the system's documentation available in the repository.
