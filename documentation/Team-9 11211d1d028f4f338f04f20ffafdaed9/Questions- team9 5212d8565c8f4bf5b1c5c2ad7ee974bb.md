1. Are there any specific data sources or methodologies that you recommend for estimating emissions in the absence of comprehensive emission data for all farms? 
2. Is it advisable to generate dummy data?
3. We were unable to obtain emission data for public farms in the US, so we are building our own emission calculator for farms. Is this is a viable alternative? This data will then be used to feed ML model.
4. Considering the computational constraints, mapping all the farms in the US could be a challenging task- so we are considering mapping 20 farms from each state. Is this a good approach to go ahead with? Any suggestion here?
5. Any best practices or guidelines for incorporating different parameters (such as land usage, farming type, technology used) into the emissions model? What factors should we prioritize or weigh more heavily in our calculations?
